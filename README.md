# Cell_Compare


An emulation of Conditional Formatting in automation scenarios. It Loops through excel range and performs logic operations.  It wll basically, populate a range from a list and then see if each value satisfies a condition.  If True, the cellbackground will change to yellow. 

It is good when dealing with small projects, but you may want to be prudent when working with large data sets since it can get really slow.
